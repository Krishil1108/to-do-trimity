## Python Library Reference (Alternative)

If you need Python implementation, these libraries provide similar functionality:

### Python NLP Libraries with Grammar Rules:
1. **LanguageTool Python** (`language_tool_python`)
   - Same LanguageTool API
   - Python wrapper
   - All grammar rules included

2. **GingerIt** 
   - Grammar correction
   - Spelling fixes
   - API-based

3. **TextBlob**
   - Basic NLP
   - Spelling correction
   - Part-of-speech tagging

4. **spaCy**
   - Advanced NLP
   - Dependency parsing
   - Named entity recognition
   - Custom rules possible

5. **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**
   - Comprehensive NLP
   - Tokenization, stemming
   - Grammar parsing
   - WordNet integration

6. **Gramformer**
   - AI-powered grammar correction
   - Deep learning based
   - State-of-the-art results

### Installation (Python):
```bash
pip install language-tool-python gingerit textblob spacy nltk gramformer
```

### Example Usage (Python):
```python
import language_tool_python

# Initialize
tool = language_tool_python.LanguageTool('en-US')

# Check grammar
text = "He go to school yesterday"
matches = tool.check(text)

# Apply corrections
corrected = language_tool_python.utils.correct(text, matches)
print(corrected)  # "He went to school yesterday"
```

However, **the Node.js implementation we created is more suitable** for this project as:
- Integrates directly with existing JavaScript backend
- Uses free LanguageTool API
- Includes custom business logic
- Optimized for MOM processing
- No additional Python runtime needed
