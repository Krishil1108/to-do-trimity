🧪 QUICK START GUIDE - Console Grammar Testing
================================================

1️⃣  START THE APP
   Open: http://localhost:3000

2️⃣  OPEN BROWSER CONSOLE
   Press F12 (or Ctrl+Shift+J on Windows)

3️⃣  TEST YOUR SENTENCE
   Copy and paste this into the console:

   window.testGrammar("i want to go for shopping and eating chocolate for make my 31st night amazing")

4️⃣  EXPECTED OUTPUT
   ✅ I want to go shopping and eat chocolate to make my 31st night amazing

   Changes that should be made:
   • i → I (capitalization)
   • go for shopping → go shopping (idiomatic verb)
   • eating → eat (parallel structure)
   • for make → to make (infinitive correction)

5️⃣  MORE EXAMPLES

   // Test multiple sentences at once
   window.testGrammar([
     "i want to go for shopping",
     "he go to school everyday", 
     "she are working hard"
   ])

   // Compare with expected result
   window.testGrammarDetailed(
     "i want to go for shopping",
     "I want to go shopping"
   )

   // Run full test suite (8 tests)
   window.runGrammarTests()

   // Just get the corrected text
   const result = await window.checkGrammar("your text here")
   console.log(result)

6️⃣  INTERPRETING RESULTS

   ✅ = Test passed / Text corrected
   ❌ = Test failed / Error occurred
   ⏱️  = Processing time in milliseconds
   📊 = Summary statistics
   ✨ = List of specific changes made

7️⃣  DEBUGGING WORKFLOW

   1. Test sentence in console
   2. See what grammar rules are applied
   3. Compare actual vs expected output
   4. If issues found, check textProcessingService.js
   5. Make changes to backend
   6. Restart backend
   7. Refresh frontend
   8. Test again in console

8️⃣  PRODUCTION TESTING

   You can also use this on the deployed production site!
   Just open console and run the same commands.
